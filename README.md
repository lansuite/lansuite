## Installation

### Docker

We assume that you have a running [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) installed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lansuite/lansuite.git
$ cd lansuite
$ touch ./inc/base/config.php
$ # Add the content of the example configuration file below into ./inc/base/config.php 
$ chmod 0777 ./inc/base/config.php
$ chmod -R 0777 ./ext_inc/
$ docker-compose up
```

This will start a [Nginx webserver](https://nginx.org/) with a [php-fpm](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php) configuration and a [MySQL database](https://www.mysql.com/) for you.
After everything started you should be able to visit http://<Your-Docker-IP>:8080/ and see a running LanSuite-System.

### Configuration file

An example configuration file looks like:

```ini
[lansuite]
version=Nightly
default_design=simple
chmod_dir=777
chmod_file=666
debugmode=0

[database]
server=mysql
user=root
passwd=
database=lansuite
prefix=ls_
charset=utf8
```

**Warning**: Setting directories to `0777` is not suggested for production. Only your webserver user should be able to write into this directory.

## Development

### Contribution Guide

### Language

Main language of this project is english.
We also support issues and pull requests in german.
The reason is that LANSuite is a quite old system and a massive userbase only speaks german.
To not loose them, we will support both languages.
See [Switch language of documentation, development, communication to english #2](https://github.com/lansuite/lansuite/issues/2) for more details.
