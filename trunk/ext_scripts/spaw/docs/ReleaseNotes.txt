SPAW Editor PHP Edition
version 1.1
Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded, tried and supported SPAW Editor!

Here is updated Gecko compatible release of SPAW Editor PHP Edition. Now
it should be stable on modern Gecko based browsers. It should also
work on PHP5 from now on without any modifications.

Here's the list of known issues and limitations in Gecko implementation. Please,
don't report these as bugs!

- Cut, Copy and Paste functions aren't available cause they are disabled in
  Mozilla for security reasons and it takes editing config files to enable them
- Word cleanup is not implemented, yet
- Borders on borderless objects feature is not implemented
- Table functions (insert/delete row/column, merge/split cells) are not yet
  implemented (but you can insert/delete rows/columns visually in gecko)
- Dialogs aren't really modal. So you can bug the behavior if you move cursor 
  in the editor area while dialog is open.
- You need to change paragraph values in config file to <H1>, <H2>, etc. in 
  order for paragraphs to work in Gecko. It will also work in IE but wont
  be reflected in active toolbar

Check out ChangeLog.txt for the list of new features and bugfixes.

If you are fluent in any of languages that are now included and 
see any typos or mistakes please report to spaw@solmetra.com
