In April 2017 we kicked off the development of LANSuite again.
Since then more than 900 commits including tons of bug fixes were done.

During the development, various people opened issues in our GitHub issue tracker and reported bugs, contributed to discussions, requested features and asked questions related to LANSuite.

Especially the last point, asking questions, will be tackled with this announcement. **Today we are launching the new documentation of LANSuite**.

<!--truncate-->

With the new documentation suite, we want to make LANSuite more accessible and more comfortable for our users. The articles in it are far from complete, but we will extend those over time.
Especially with questions asked by users.

## Contribution

A contribution is welcome.
If you know a particular area of LANSuite and think that others can benefit from it, [send us a Pull Request](https://github.com/lansuite/lansuite/pulls).
We would be happy to review it.

## Technical background

This documentation page is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). An open source project by [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus).

Articles are written in [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and are organized in `.md` files in the [`doc` folder in our repository](https://github.com/lansuite/lansuite/tree/master/docs).

That's it so far.
Let see what the future brings and what documentation articles will be written.
Happy documenting!
