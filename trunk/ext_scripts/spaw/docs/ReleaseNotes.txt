SPAW Editor PHP Edition
version 1.1 RC1
Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded, tried and supported SPAW Editor!

Here is updated Gecko compatible release of SPAW Editor PHP Edition. Now
it should be quite stable (at least with the latest version of Firefox).
Active toolbar now works in Gecko and lots of language files have been
added or updated.

Here's the list of know issues and limitations in Gecko implementation. Please,
don't report these as bugs!

- Cut, Copy and Paste function aren't available cause they are disabled in
  Mozilla for security reasons and it takes editing config files to enable them
- Word cleanup is not implemented, yet
- Borders on borderless objects feature is not implemented
- Table functions (insert/delete row/column, merge/split cells) are not yet
  implemented (but you can insert/delete rows/columns visually in gecko)
- Dialogs aren't really modal. So you can bug the behavior if you move cursor 
  in the editor area while dialog is open.
- Dialogs look a bit different compared to IE in "default" theme (theme wasn't 
  updated yet)
- In hyperlink dialog non-applicable rows aren't hidden (like in IE) when
  switching between link, anchor and link to anchor
- You need to change paragraph values in config file to <H1>, <H2>, etc. in 
  order for paragraphs to work in Gecko. It will also work in IE but wont
  be reflected in active toolbar
- Documentation is not updated
